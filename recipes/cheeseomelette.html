        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a recipe of cheese omelette I took from the site <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/262696/cheese-omelette/">allrecipes</a>.</p>
        <p>We all know that omlette is a great dish for breakfast, and so everyone should know how to make one.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large Eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of Milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground White Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of Butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of shredded Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
            <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
        </ol>
