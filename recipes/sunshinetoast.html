            <li>2 tablespoons of Butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large Egg</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut a circle in the center of bread with a cookie cutter. Brush melted butter on both sides of bread.</li>
            <li>Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add bread and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip, then crack egg into the hole. Cook until egg is set on the bottom, about 1 minute; season with salt. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until egg white is completely set, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
